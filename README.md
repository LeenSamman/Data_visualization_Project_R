# **Student Performance & Dropout Analysis**  

This Shiny app analyzes student performance to predict whether a student will **drop out, graduate, or remain enrolled**. The project was developed for our **data visualization course** and received the **Best Project** award.  

## **Project Overview**  
Our analysis explores student performance using **various visualization techniques** while ensuring data accuracy through careful encoding and mapping.  

## **Data Details**  
- The dataset was **categorically and ordinally encoded**, meaning features were stored as numerical values.  
- We **mapped these numbers to their true categorical labels** using a published paper that utilized the same dataset and applied similar visualizations.  
- The dataset includes **two numerical grading features (1-20) for each semester**.  
- After researching **Portugalâ€™s grading system**, we identified four performance categories: **Failing, Passing, Good, and Excellent**.  
- We created **two new columns** representing students' performance levels to analyze the correlation between **grades and dropout rates**.  

## **Visualizations & Techniques**  
Our project includes various **data visualizations**, following best practices from our course materials:  
- **Amount Distributions**  
- **Proportions & Nested Proportions**  
- **Geospatial Data**  
- **Uncertainty Analysis**  

## **Goal of the Analysis**  
By analyzing and visualizing key features, we aim to **predict student outcomes** and identify potential dropout risks based on performance trends.
